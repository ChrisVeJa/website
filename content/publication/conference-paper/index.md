abstract: In this article, I study the macroeconomic implications of a potential heterogeneous impact of changes in weather conditions on economic performance, as well as the role of interregional connections in transmitting these effects. Using annual data from 59 sectors and 48 states during the last five decades, I show that unanticipated weather shocks have heterogeneous and nonlinear impacts on economic growth across industries and states, with the geographical dimension being particularly important. Results show that the presence of heterogeneity amplifies the negative effect of large temperature deviations. For example, when heterogeneity is considered, the aggregate effect on the economic growth of an unanticipated increase in temperature of one Celsius degree passes from -0.18 to -0.29 percent. Finally, adding interregional linkages through production networks amplifies these negative effects with sizable effects in the aggregate level.
