abstract: We investigate how mental health evolves over the life cycle and how it has changed in the last twenty years. The goal of the paper is to provide comprehensive empirical documentation of mental health using datasets that Economists typically employ. We use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). We document an inverted U-shape of mental health over the life cycle with an inflection point around the retirement age. We also document large disparities in mental health over the life cycle, with males, married individuals, and individuals with children reporting better mental health than their counterparts. Over time, we find a very stable pattern of mental health on average, with strong fluctuations corresponding to major events such as recessions and the COVID-19 pandemic. Interestingly, while the average as a whole has been stable, we document that the differences within demographic groups by sex, marital status, and the presence of children have widened in the last 20 years.
