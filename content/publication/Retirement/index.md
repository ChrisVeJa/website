abstract: We document the evolution of mental health over the life cycle and over time in the last twenty years. We provide comprehensive empirical mental health documentation using datasets that Economists typically employ. We use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). We document an inverted U-shape of mental health over the life cycle with an inflection point around the retirement age. Using an econometric analysis, we document large disparities by income, wealth, sex, race, marital status, and the presence of children over the life cycle. The rich, males, married individuals, whites, and individuals with children report better mental health than their counterparts. Over time, we find a very stable pattern of mental health on average, with strong fluctuations corresponding to major events such as recessions and the COVID-19 pandemic. Interestingly, while the average has been stable, we document that the differences in mental health by income, wealth, and demographic characteristics have widened in the last 20 years. We further study the inflection point around retirement using an Event Study Design to assess whether the retirement event affects mental health. We find that retirement negatively affects mental health and that this effect is significant.
